# Facetext-Fusion
FaceText Fusion is an innovative project that bridges the gap between visual and textual data through advanced deep learning techniques. The project integrates two core functionalities:

## Face-to-Text Conversion:
By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, this module generates descriptive textual representations from input facial images. This is designed for applications such as automated captioning or facial feature analysis.

## Text-to-Face Generation:
This module employs Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create realistic facial images from textual descriptions. It is ideal for tasks like sketch-to-image generation, identity recovery, and creative applications.
