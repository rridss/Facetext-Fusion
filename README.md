# Facetext-Fusion
FaceText Fusion is an innovative project that bridges the gap between visual and textual data through advanced deep learning techniques. The project integrates two core functionalities:

## Face-to-Text Conversion:
By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, this module generates descriptive textual representations from input facial images. This is designed for applications such as automated captioning or facial feature analysis.

## Result

## Text-to-Face Generation:
This module employs Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create realistic facial images from textual descriptions. It is ideal for tasks like sketch-to-image generation, identity recovery, and creative applications.

## Dataset
This project uses the CelebA Dataset, a large-scale dataset containing over 200,000 celebrity images with accompanying attribute annotations. It is widely used in face-related machine learning research.

## Steps to Download the CelebA Dataset:
Visit the official CelebA Dataset page.
Request access and follow the instructions provided by the site to download the dataset.
Once downloaded, organize the dataset into folders:
img_align_celeba/ for the aligned face images.
list_attr_celeba.csv for the attribute annotations.
text_shuffle_descr_celeba.csv for textual descriptions
